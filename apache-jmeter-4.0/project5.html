   <td>21.60</td>
   <td>No prepared statements seem to significantly cause the speed of the test to run a lot slower. We assume the reason for this is because it requires us to create new statements everytime the query runs once. We are not able to reuse the statements as if they were already prepared. </td>

   <td>12.21</td>
   <td>In this test, we got rid of pooling in the single instance. Connection pooling seems to slightly help the speed of the test. The reason for this is because we can reuse database connections for different requests. In other words, we only need to create 1 connection and then use that connection multiple times (in our case 2650 times) for each movie request search.</td>

   <td>No connection pooling with the scaled instance shows that it is faster. In our specific test, it seems like in the scaled instance, the connection pooling has a larger impact on the speed than the prepared statements compared to the single instance. The reason for this isn't quite clear, but we assume that it has to relate to the fact that we use master and slaves.</td>
